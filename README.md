# Tipsy Mobile
Tipsy is a simple tip calculator designed for use in a simple, hour-long crash
course on modern JavaScript development. The mobile version show cases the
following:

- modern JavaScript idioms through the use of ES2017 syntax
- modern programming paradigm through the use of subtle functional programming 
  techniques and Ramda
- modern UI frameworks through the use of React-Native and React-Base
- modern development work-flow through the use of Expo (including hot module
  reloading)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
